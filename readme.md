## Using NESpire

First, you must have Ndless installed to use NESpire.

Any NES ROM you wish to play must be named with a .nes.tns extension, and
sent to the calculator in the same folder NESpire was sent to. Open NESpire
from the documents menu, and you will be presented with the ROM selection
menu. Choose a ROM using the arrow keys and press Shift to select one,
or press Esc to exit.

## Controls

Game controls:

- `Tab`   = B
- `Esc`   = A
- `Clear` = Select
- `Shift` = Start

Emulator controls:

- `1`-`6` = Set frameskip (Default is 3 on the original TI-Nspire, 1 on the CX)
- `7`   = Save state
- `9`   = Load state
- `*`   = Fast-forward
- `B`   = Reverse border color
- `P`   = Pause (Many NES games have their own pause feature, but it will still consume just as much power as when playing the game. Using P to pause is preferred, so as not to waste battery life.)
- `Q`   = Quit
- `R`   = Reverse colors
- `S`   = Write save file (Only applicable to games which actually have battery-backed save memory; e.g. Zelda, Final Fantasy)
