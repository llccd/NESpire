## Using NESpire

First, you must have Ndless installed to use NESpire.

Any NES ROM you wish to play must be named with a .nes.tns extension, and
sent to the calculator in the same folder NESpire was sent to. Open NESpire
from the documents menu, and you will be presented with the ROM selection
menu. Choose a ROM using the arrow keys and press Menu to select one,
or press Esc to exit.
